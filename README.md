Introduction
I am currently learning the Java programming language. This document serves as a guide to understand the basic organization of a Java project, facilitating code development and maintenance.

Project Structure
The project is organized into three main folders:

src: contains the source files written in Java.

lib: stores the external libraries and dependencies required for the project.

bin: the location where the compiled files (bytecode) are generated after the compilation process.

This organization contributes to a clearer and more organized workflow, allowing separation between source code, dependencies, and compiled artifacts.

If necessary, the folder structure can be customized according to the specific needs of the project.

Dependency Management
Proper dependency management is essential to ensure that all external libraries used are available and up to date. This facilitates the building, execution, and maintenance of the project.
